A Spanish family recently moved to Munich, Germany and they would like to start a business in the food industry. 
They are thinking on opening a tapas bar in the heart of the city and they will use mainly the Foursquare API to do some research in the area to see if is worth the effort and money to do it. 
They expect to reach people who speak Spanish (people from Spain, from Latin America and people who learnt it as a second language).
