For the city analysis the family will use the immigration information provided by the State of Bavaria (https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/) which will tell us about the amount of Spanish and latin people who resides in the city currently.  
For example, in the city there is currently living 9,087 Spanish people and approximately 6,170 latin people in Munich. They could be potential customers.   
Also, the menus can be written in English and German to attract more people.  
They will also use Foursquare API to collect information about the bars with tapas topic and they ratings.  
The main goal will be to find a spot in the city close enough to the centre and main attractions, where the neighbours bars don't have great ratings (in order to not compete with them)
