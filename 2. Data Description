For the city analysis the family will use the inmigration information provided by the State of Bavaria (https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/) which will tell us about the amount of spanish and latin people who resides in the city currently.
For example, in the city there is currently living 9,087 spanish people and aproximately 6,170 latin people in Munich. They could be potential customers. 
Also, the menues can be written in English and German to attract more people.

They will also use Foursquare API to collect information about the bars with tapas topic and they ratings.
The main goal will be to find a spot in the city close enough to the center and main atractions, where the neighborn bars dont have great ratings (in order to not compete with them)
